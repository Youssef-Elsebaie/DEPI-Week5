üìå Week 5 Highlights at Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI | Penetration Testing Track

This week, I delved deeper into the fascinating world of penetration testing, focusing on:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Stages of Penetration Testing:

Reconnaissance: Gathering essential intel about the target.
Scanning: Mapping systems and identifying potential entry points.
Exploitation: Discovering and leveraging vulnerabilities.
Persistence: Simulating sustained access to the system.
Reporting: Documenting findings and providing actionable solutions.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing Methodologies:

White-Box: Full access for comprehensive analysis.
Black-Box: Mimicking an external attacker with no prior knowledge.
Grey-Box: Partial access for a balanced perspective.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Practical Application:
I also worked on an email spoofing report, exploring techniques and crafting recommendations to mitigate this threat effectively.

Excited for the next steps in this incredible journey of mastering cybersecurity! üöÄ
